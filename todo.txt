-- TODO:

verification
--- duplicate entries? zb Kurs count. to make it identifiable.
--- missing values. categories: missing, reference not available.

--- wie oft hat sich eine person gemeldet.

for process mining:
-code, abgabe or forum

--- @ Extraction
-- * implement abgabe specific crawls
-- * implement forum specific crawls
-- * implement register specific crawls

--- @ Validation

--- @ Transformation
4- * <sub> in Forum has to be handled. OR: post-process to identify

--- @ CSV export
--- * export all person objects, service specific person objects: code, abgabe, forum, register

-------
-------
-- DONE * implement traversable for object, that allows updating changes
-- ABORT * perform matrikelnummer extraction and transformation
-- DONE * implement general csv export from filtered Object arrays
-- DONE * implement code specific crawls
-- DONE * extract descriptions.csv as real object to make it queryable
-- DONE * need to persistently store the progress and temporary objects...can't process in one go
-- DONE * extract text of element
-- DONE * include the full path for each object, in order to transform metadata from that path later
-- DONE * write general recursive directory crawler that searches for specific xml files
-- DONE * store the service name where a given object was collected from
--
-- DONE use an instance of RNGElement to recursively parse an xml file.
--
-- DONE The output is a hierarchical Object, which holds: tag name, attribute map,
--      child objects.
--
--      How to determine relevant objects? by frequency, those that only occur only
--      once specifies grouping. for example <persons> vs <person>
--
--      Use an instance of Eq, and Ord, so the objects can be grouped -> (object, freq).
--
-- DONE * aggregate objects that occur in all services: person
-- DONE * serialize that aggregated object structure, create a little framewrk to perform manipulations on it

MAYBE * need to parse <data> under <element> in order to determine whether to extract text or not
MAYBE * persist all different schema types in services
MAYBE * compare persisted schema types. Note the ones that don't match. Otherwise aggregate globally like <person>
MAYBE * find objects that are similar but slightly differ. compare the frequencies
